# etchASketch

This website is an exersize where I attempted to build my version of an electronic etch-a-sketch based on the criteria provided by The Odin Project. (Link to project - https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/etch-a-sketch-project)

In this exersize I will be experimenting with many different kinds of grids methods - Primarilly CSS Grid.

The divs are not created by hand and are instead created in the DOM by the javascript and then arranged with the help of some custom attributes in order to compute some sizes in the CSS. This allowed me to easilly keep the draw area the same size while increasing the number of pixels being drawn.

Then on mouseover the html redirects to the javascript which adds a new tag on to the element in turn changing it's colour.
